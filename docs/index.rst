Welcome to Matching's documentation!
====================================

Matching is a package for solving matching games.

Matching games allow for the allocation of resources and partnerships in a fair
way. Typically, a matching game is defined by two sets of players that each have
preferences over at least some of the elements of the other set. The objective
of the game is then to find a mapping between the sets of players in which
everyone is *happy enough* with their match.

In Matching, we deal with the following types of matching game:

- the stable marriage problem (SM)
- the hospital-resident assignment problem (HR)
- the student-allocation problem (SA)
- the stable roommates problem (SR)
